# Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹, I'm Axel Nicholas Lorens
A passionate software engineer from South San Francisco, CA

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on two major roles in software development:

1. **iOS Software Engineer (Lead Frontend Developer)** - At SocialTech Labs, I'm leading a frontend team using **Swift** and **SwiftUI**. Iâ€™m responsible for developing and integrating new features, such as a song-sharing tool with APIs for Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube, and creating widgets for real-time updates. I'm also learning **Go** and **AWS** on the side, since I'm interested in being a Full Stack Developer.

2. **Software Engineering Intern** - At Open Learning Exchange, I work primarily with **Angular** and **CouchDB** to enhance the Planet Learning app. My responsibilities include improving user experience, deploying with **Docker**, and collaborating with colleagues to optimize the educational platform. I'm still new but enjoying learning new things in this job.

> Although `Java` is my most used language here, I would say I'm more experienced with Javascript, Python, and Swift as they are my recently used languages in over 1-2 year :D
